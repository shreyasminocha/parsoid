/* A map of tests which we know Parsoid currently fails.
 *
 * New patches which fix previously-broken tests should also patch this
 * file to document which tests are now expected to succeed.
 *
 * This helps clean up 'npm test' output, documents known bugs, and helps
 * Jenkins make sense of the parserTest output.
 *
 * NOTE that the selser blacklist depends on tests/selser.changes.json
 * If the selser change list is modified, this blacklist should be refreshed.
 *
 * This blacklist can be automagically updated by running
 *    parserTests.js --rewrite-blacklist
 * You might want to do this after you fix some bug that makes more tests
 * pass.  It is still your responsibility to carefully review the blacklist
 * diff to ensure there are no unexpected new failures (lines added).
